# CITRUSüçä: A phenotype simulation tool with the flexibility to model complex interactions

CITRUS, the CIs and Trans inteRaction nUmerical Simulator, is a tool for simulating phenotypes with complex genetic archetectures that go beyond simple models that assume linear, additive contributions of individual SNPs. The goal of this tool is to provide better simulations for benchmarking GWAS/PRS models.
