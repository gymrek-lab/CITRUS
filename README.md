# CITRUS: A tool for simulating complex traits with flexible genetic architectures

CITRUS, the CIs and Trans inteRaction nUmerical Simulator, is a tool for simulating phenotypes with complex genetic archetectures. The goal of this tool is to provide better simulations for benchmarking GWAS/PRS models.

cis and trans interactions, haplotype effects
